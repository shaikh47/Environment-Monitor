# Environment-Monitor
IOT based web project to monitor various environment data. The project consists of a hardware and a software part. Hardware part contains a bunch of sensors to monitor the environment, an arduino microcontroller has been used to process the sensor datas. And a nodeMCU acts as a network device to upload the information to the Firebase database. The software part has an IOT website, with which the information is represented both textually and graphically.

## Features
1. Live  Data Monitoring 
2. Easy track of sound pollution as, the Average, Minimum and Maximum sound data is recorded and stored. 
3. Virtual traffic light implemented, which turns red if people keep honking deliberately. This way sound pollution induced by vehicle horn can be reduced.
4. Live alert implemented, which can be used in classrooms or libraries. Basically an error can be generated if the sound reaches a particular threshold.
5. Temperature, Humidity, Air-Pressure can be monitored in real time.
